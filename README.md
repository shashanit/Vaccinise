VACCINE REMINDER APP:

The code will currently ask for date birth , once enetered it will check age in days and if there is any vaccine for that date it will send out a notification.

The code automatically switches on the app at 9 am everyday and checks the age and if any vaccine available it shows the vaccine in notification.

This is basic which is done.
